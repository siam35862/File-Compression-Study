/**
 * Residual histogram model: tracks the distribution of (partial_actual_value − predicted_value) residuals.
 * The partial_actual_value is the already known bits of the actual byte.
 * Calculating the predicted_value is the responsibility of the caller.
 * Determining the context is also the responsibility of the caller.
 * The distribution is modelling the probability of the next bit in the partial byte being a "1".
 * The context is direct (not hashed). For each byte context modelled, the exact next bit counts are stored.
 *
 * For each context we maintain a running prefix-sum histogram (cumulative counts) over 256 residual bins.
 * Residuals of the full byte would be centered around 0 usually following a Laplacian distribution.
 * A perfect prediction of the full byte gives residual 0.
 * The partial residual uses only the bits known so far, so it converges toward the full residual as more bits are decoded.
 * 
 * The histogram is circular (mod 256) to handle underflows of the difference (partial_actual_value − predicted_value).
 * As a speed optimization, the center is moved from #0 to #192. Since residuals cluster near 0 (mapped to bin #192),
 * the suffix increment loop [bin, BINS) is shorter on average when the center is near the high end of the array.
 * It also reduces how often a query window wraps around, keeping lookups cache-friendly.
 *
 * Read  (mix):    O(numContexts); O(1) per context - four array lookups and two subtractions per window.
 * Write (update): O(BINS) - increment all suffix entries by 1. Sequential, cache-friendly.
 * Halve (aging):  O(BINS) - halve all entries when the total count would not fit in 16 bits.
 *
 * Layout: sums[base+k] = count[0]+...+count[k], k=0..BINS-1.
 *         sums[base+BINS-1] = total.
