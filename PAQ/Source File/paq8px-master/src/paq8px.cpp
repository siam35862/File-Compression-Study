    "Detailed Help\n"
    "=============\n"
    "\n"
    "---------------\n"
    " 1. Compression\n"
    "---------------\n"
    "\n"
    "  Compression levels control the amount of memory used during both compression and decompression.\n"
    "  Higher levels generally improve compression ratio at the cost of higher memory usage and slower speed.\n"
    "  Specifying the compression level is needed only for compression - no need to specify it for decompression.\n"
    "  Approximately the same amount of memory will be used during compression and decompression.\n"
    "\n"
    "  The listed memory usage for each LEVEL (-1 = 558 MB .. -12 = 29358 MB) is typical/indicative for compressing binary\n"
    "  files with no preprocessing. Actual memory use is lower for text files and higher when a preprocessing step\n"
    "  (segmentation and transformations) requires temporary memory. When special file types are detected, special models\n"
    "  (image, jpg, audio) will be used and thus will require extra RAM.\n"
    "\n"
    "------------------\n"
    " 2. Special Levels\n"
    "------------------\n"
    "\n"
    "  -0   Only block type detection (segmentation) and block transformations are performed.\n"
    "       The data is copied (verbatim or transformed); no compression happens.\n"
    "       This mode is similar to a preprocessing-only tool like precomp.\n"
    "       Uses approximately 3-7 MB total.\n"
    "\n"
    "  -0L  Uses only a single LSTM model for prediction, which is shared across all block types.\n"
    "       Uses approximately 20-24 MB total RAM.\n"
    "       Alternative: -lstmonly\n"
    "\n"
    "---------------------\n"
    " 3. Compression Flags\n"
    "---------------------\n"
    "\n"
    "  Compression flags are single-letter, case-insensitive, and appended directly to the level.\n"
    "  They are valid only during compression. No need to specify them for decompression.\n"
    "\n"
    "  L   Enable the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model.\n"
    "      Uses a fixed-size model, independent of compression level.\n"
    "\n"
    "      At level -0L (also: -lstmonly) a single LSTM model is used for prediction for all detected block types.\n"
    "      Block detection and segmentation are still performed, but no Context Mixing or Secondary Symbol\n"
    "      Estimation (SSE) stage is used.\n"
    "\n"
    "      At higher levels (-1L .. -12L) the LSTM model is included as a submodel in Context Mixing and its predictions\n"
    "      are mixed with the other models.\n"
    "      When special block types are detected, for each block type an individual LSTM model is created dynamically and\n"
    "      used within that block type. Each such LSTM model adds approximately 24 MB to the total memory use.\n"
    "\n"
    "  A   Enable adaptive learning rate in the CM mixer.\n"
    "      May improve compression for some files.\n"
    "\n"
    "  S   Skip RGB color transform for 24/32-bit images.\n"
    "      Useful when the transform worsens compression.\n"
    "      This flag has no effect when no image block types are detected.\n"
    "\n"
    "  B   Enable brute-force DEFLATE stream detection.\n"
    "      Slower but may improve detection of compressed streams.\n"
    "\n"
    "  E   Pre-train the x86/x64 executable model.\n"
    "      This option pre-trains the EXE model using the " PROGNAME ".exe binary itself.\n"
    "      Archives created with a different " PROGNAME ".exe executable (even when built from the same source and build options)\n"
    "      will differ. To decompress an archive created with -E, you must use the exact same executable that created it.\n"
    "\n"
    "  T   Pre-train text-oriented models using a dictionary and expression list.\n"
    "      The word list (english.dic) and expression list (english.exp) are used only to pre-train models before\n"
    "      compression and they are not stored in the archive.\n"
    "      You must have these same files available to decompress archives created with -T.\n"
    "\n"
    "---------------------------\n"
    " 4. Block Detection Control\n"
    "---------------------------\n"
    "\n"
    "  Block detection and segmentation always happen regardless of the memory level or other options - except when forced:\n"
    "\n"
    "  -forcebinary\n"
    "\n"
    "      Disable block detection; the whole file is considered as a single binary block and only the generic (binary)\n"
    "      model set will be used.\n"
    "      Useful when block detection produces false positives.\n"
    "\n"
    "  -forcetext\n"
    "\n"
    "      Disable block detection; consider the whole file as a single text block and use the text model set only.\n"
    "      Useful when text data is misclassified as binary or fragments in a text file are incorrectly detected as some\n"
    "      other block type.\n"
    "\n"
    "---------------------------------------\n"
    " 5. LSTM-Specific Options (expert-only)\n"
    "---------------------------------------\n"
    "\n"
    "  -lstmlayers=N\n"
    "\n"
    "      Set the number of LSTM layers to N. Using more layers generally leads to better compression, but memory use\n"
    "      will be higher (scales linearly with N) and compression time will be significantly slower. The default is N=2.\n"
    "\n"
    "  -savelstm:text FILE\n"
    "\n"
    "      Saves the LSTM model's learned parameters as a lossless snapshot to the specified file when compression finishes.\n"
    "      Only the model used for text block(s) will be saved.\n"
    "      It's not possible to save a snapshot from other block types. This is an experimental feature.\n"
    "\n"
    "  -loadlstm:text FILE\n"
    "\n"
    "      Loads the LSTM model's learned parameters from the specified file (which was saved earlier\n"
    "      by the -savelstm:text option) before compression starts. The LSTM model will use this loaded\n"
    "      snapshot to bootstrap its predictions.\n"
    "      At levels -1L .. -12L only text blocks are affected.\n"
    "      At level -0L all blocks are affected (because a single LSTM model is used for all block types).\n"
    "      Critical: The same snapshot file MUST be used during decompression or the original content cannot be recovered.\n"
    "\n"
    "----------------------\n"
    " 6. Archive Operations\n"
    "----------------------\n"
    "\n"
    "  -d  Decompress an archive.\n"
    "      In single-file mode the content is decompressed, the name of the output is the name of the archive without\n"
    "      the ." PROGNAME PROGVERSION " extension.\n"
    "      In multi-file mode first the @LISTFILE is extracted then the rest of the files. Any required folders will\n"
    "      be created recursively, all files will be extracted with their original names.\n"
    "      If the output file or files already exist they will be overwritten.\n"
    "\n"
    "      Example: to decompress file.txt to the current folder:\n"
    "      " PROGNAME " -d file.txt." PROGNAME PROGVERSION "\n"
    "\n"
    "  -t  Test archive contents by decompressing to memory and comparing with the original data on-the-fly.\n"
    "      If a file fails the test, the first mismatched position will be printed to screen.\n"
    "\n"
    "      Example: to test archive contents:\n"
    "      " PROGNAME " -t file.txt." PROGNAME PROGVERSION "\n"
    "\n"
    "  -l  List archive contents.\n"
    "      Extracts and prints the embedded @FILELIST (if present).\n"
    "      Applicable only to multi-file archives.\n"
    "\n"
    "      Example: to list the file list (when the archive was created using @files):\n"
    "      " PROGNAME " -l files." PROGNAME PROGVERSION "\n"
    "\n"
    "----------------------------------\n"
    " 7. INPUT and OUTPUT Specification\n"
    "----------------------------------\n"
    "\n"
    "  INPUT may be:\n"
    "\n"
    "  * A single file\n"
    "  * A path/file\n"
    "  * A [path/]@FILELIST\n"
    "\n"
    "  In multi-file mode (i.e. when @FILELIST is provided) only file names, file contents and file sizes are stored\n"
    "  in the archive. Timestamps, permissions, attributes or any other metadata are not preserved unless stored\n"
    "  separately and manually by the user in the FILELIST.\n"
    "\n"
    "  OUTPUT is optional:\n"
    "\n"
    "    For compression:\n"
    "\n"
    "    * If omitted, the archive is created in the current directory.\n"
    "      The name of the archive: INPUT + " PROGNAME PROGVERSION " extension appended.\n"
    "    * If a filename is given, it is used as the archive name.\n"
    "    * If a directory is given, the archive is created inside it.\n"
    "    * If the archive file already exists, it will be overwritten.\n"
    "\n"
    "    For decompression:\n"
    "\n"
    "    * If an output filename is not provided, the output will be named the same as the archive without\n"
    "      the " PROGNAME PROGVERSION " extension.\n"
    "    * If a filename is given, it is used as the output name.\n"
    "    * If a directory is given, the restored file will be created inside it (the directory must exist).\n"
    "    * If the output file(s) already exist, they will be overwritten.\n"
    "\n"
    "  Examples:\n"
    "\n"
    "  To create data.txt." PROGNAME PROGVERSION " in current directory:\n"
    "  " PROGNAME " -8 data.txt\n"
    "\n"
    "  To create archive." PROGNAME PROGVERSION " in current directory:\n"
    "  " PROGNAME " -8 data.txt archive." PROGNAME PROGVERSION "\n"
    "\n"
    "  To create data.txt." PROGNAME PROGVERSION " in results/ directory:\n"
    "  " PROGNAME " -8 data.txt results/\n"
    "\n"
    "---------------------------------\n"
    " 8. @FILELIST Format and Behavior\n"
    "---------------------------------\n"
    "\n"
    "  When a @FILELIST is provided, the FILELIST file itself is compressed as the first file in the archive and\n"
    "  automatically extracted during decompression.\n"
    "\n"
    "  The FILELIST is a tab-separated text file with this structure:\n"
    "\n"
    "    Column 1:  Filenames and optional relative paths (required, used by compressor)\n"
    "    Column 2+: Arbitrary metadata - timestamps, ownership, etc. (optional, preserved but ignored)\n"
    "\n"
    "    First line: Header (preserved but ignored during processing the file list)\n"
    "\n"
    "  Only the first column is used by the compressor and decompressor.\n"
    "  All other columns are preserved but ignored.\n"
    "  Paths must be relative to the FILELIST location.\n"
    "\n"
    "  Using this mechanism allows full restoration of file metadata with third-party tools after decompression.\n"
    "  \n"
    "\n"
    "-------------------------\n"
    " 9. Miscellaneous Options\n"
    "-------------------------\n"
    "\n"
    "  -v\n"
    "\n"
    "    Enable verbose output.\n"
    "\n"
    "  -log FILE\n"
    "\n"
    "    Append compression results to a tab-separated log file.\n"
    "    Logging applies only to compression.\n"
    "\n"
    "  -simd MODE\n"
    "\n"
    "    Normally, the highest usable SIMD instruction set is detected and used automatically\n"
    "\n"
    "    - for the CM mixer - supported: SSE2, AVX2, AVX512, ARM NEON\n"
    "    - for neural network operations in the LSTM model - supported: SSE2, AVX2\n"
    "    - for the LSM and OLS predictors (used mainly in image and audio models) - supported: SSE3.\n"
    "    - for the SimilarityModel: AVX2, SSE41.\n"
    "\n"
    "    This option overrides the detected SIMD instruction set. Intended for expert use and benchmarking.\n"
    "    Supported values (case-insensitive):\n"
    "       NONE\n"
    "       SSE2, SSE3, SSE41, AVX2, AVX512 (on x64)\n"
    "       NEON (on ARM)\n"
    "\n"
    "    Note that when paq8px is compiled for a specific CPU architecture, the compiler may automatically\n"
    "    vectorize some parts of the code. While selecting 'NONE' disables all manually optimized SIMD\n"
    "    implementations, the remaining scalar code may still be auto-vectorized by the compiler and\n"
    "    therefore may not be entirely free of vector instructions.\n"
    "\n"
    "----------------------\n"
    " 10. Argument Ordering\n"
    "----------------------\n"
    "\n"
    "  Command-line arguments may appear in any order with the following exception:\n"
    "  INPUT must always precede OUTPUT.\n"
    "\n"
    "  Example: the following two are equivalent:\n"
    "\n"
    "    " PROGNAME " -v -simd sse2 enwik8 -log results.txt output/ -8\n"
    "    " PROGNAME " -8 enwik8 -log results.txt output/ -v -simd sse2\n"
    "\n"
    "  Further examples:\n"
    "\n"
    "    " PROGNAME " -8 file.txt         | Compress using ~2.3 GB RAM\n"
    "    " PROGNAME " -12L enwik8         | Compress 'enwik8' with maximum compression (~29 GB RAM), use the LSTM model as well\n"
    "    " PROGNAME " -4 image.jpg        | Compress the 'image.jpg' file - using less memory, even faster\n"
    "    " PROGNAME " -8ba b64sample.xml  | Compress 'b64sample.xml' faster and using less memory\n"

    "                                 Use adaptive learning rate.\n"
    "    " PROGNAME " -8s rafale.bmp      | Compress the 'rafale.bmp' image file\n"
