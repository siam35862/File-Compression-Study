# PAQ8PX – Experimental Lossless Data Compressor & Entropy Estimator

## About

**PAQ** is a family of experimental, high-end lossless data compression programs.
`paq8px` is one of the longest-running branches of PAQ, started by Jan Ondrus in 2009 with major contributions 
from Márcio Pais and Zoltán Gotthardt (see [Contribution Timeline](#timeline)).

`paq8px` consistently achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios on various data compression benchmarks (see [Benchmark Results](#benchmarks)).
This performance comes at the cost of speed and memory usage, which makes it impractical for production use or long-term storage.
However, it is particularly well-suited for file entropy estimation and as a reference for compression research.

For detailed history and ongoing development discussions, see the
[paq8px thread on encode.su](https://encode.su/threads/342-paq8px).

## Quick start

`paq8px` is **portable** software – no installation is required. 

Get the latest binary for Windows (x64) from the [Releases](../../releases) page
or from the [paq8px thread on encode.su](https://encode.su/threads/342-paq8px),
or build it from source for your platform – see [below](#compile).

### Command line interface

`paq8px` does not include a graphical user interface (GUI). All operations are performed from the command line.

Open a terminal and run `paq8px` with the desired options to compress your file (such as `paq8px -8 file.txt`).  
Start with a small file – compression can take a long time.

Example output (on Windows):
```
c:\>paq8px.exe -8 file.txt
paq8px v216 (c) 2026, Matt Mahoney et al.

Creating archive file.txt.paq8px216 in single file mode...

Total archive size   : 19597

Time 16.62 sec, used 2164 MB (2269587029 bytes) of memory
```

> [!NOTE]
> The output archive extension is versioned (e.g., .paq8px216).

> [!NOTE]
> You can place the binary anywhere and reference inputs/outputs by path.

### Some examples

Compress a file at level 8 (balanced speed and compression ratio):
```
paq8px.exe -8 filename_to_compress 
```

Compress at the maximum level with LSTM modeling included (`-12L`): 
```
paq8px.exe -12L filename_to_compress 
```
> [!WARNING]
> This mode is extremely slow and memory-intensive. Make sure you have 32 GB+ RAM.

Detailed Help
=============

---------------
 1. Compression
---------------

  Compression levels control the amount of memory used during both compression and decompression.
  Higher levels generally improve compression ratio at the cost of higher memory usage and slower speed.
  Specifying the compression level is needed only for compression - no need to specify it for decompression.
  Approximately the same amount of memory will be used during compression and decompression.

  The listed memory usage for each LEVEL (-1 = 558 MB .. -12 = 29358 MB) is typical/indicative for compressing binary
  files with no preprocessing. Actual memory use is lower for text files and higher when a preprocessing step
  (segmentation and transformations) requires temporary memory. When special file types are detected, special models
  (image, jpg, audio) will be used and thus will require extra RAM.

------------------
 2. Special Levels
------------------

  -0   Only block type detection (segmentation) and block transformations are performed.
       The data is copied (verbatim or transformed); no compression happens.
       This mode is similar to a preprocessing-only tool like precomp.
       Uses approximately 3-7 MB total.

  -0L  Uses only a single LSTM model for prediction, which is shared across all block types.
       Uses approximately 20-24 MB total RAM.
       Alternative: -lstmonly

---------------------
 3. Compression Flags
---------------------

  Compression flags are single-letter, case-insensitive, and appended directly to the level.
  They are valid only during compression. No need to specify them for decompression.

  L   Enable the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model.
      Uses a fixed-size model, independent of compression level.

      At level -0L (also: -lstmonly) a single LSTM model is used for prediction for all detected block types.
      Block detection and segmentation are still performed, but no Context Mixing or Secondary Symbol
      Estimation (SSE) stage is used.

      At higher levels (-1L .. -12L) the LSTM model is included as a submodel in Context Mixing and its predictions
      are mixed with the other models.
      When special block types are detected, for each block type an individual LSTM model is created dynamically and
      used within that block type. Each such LSTM model adds approximately 24 MB to the total memory use.

  A   Enable adaptive learning rate in the CM mixer.
      May improve compression for some files.

  S   Skip RGB color transform for 24/32-bit images.
      Useful when the transform worsens compression.
      This flag has no effect when no image block types are detected.

  B   Enable brute-force DEFLATE stream detection.
      Slower but may improve detection of compressed streams.

  E   Pre-train the x86/x64 executable model.
      This option pre-trains the EXE model using the paq8px.exe binary itself.
      Archives created with a different paq8px.exe executable (even when built from the same source and build options)
      will differ. To decompress an archive created with -E, you must use the exact same executable that created it.

  T   Pre-train text-oriented models using a dictionary and expression list.
      The word list (english.dic) and expression list (english.exp) are used only to pre-train models before
      compression and they are not stored in the archive.
      You must have these same files available to decompress archives created with -T.

---------------------------
 4. Block Detection Control
---------------------------

  Block detection and segmentation always happen regardless of the memory level or other options - except when forced:

  -forcebinary

      Disable block detection; the whole file is considered as a single binary block and only the generic (binary)
      model set will be used.
      Useful when block detection produces false positives.

  -forcetext

      Disable block detection; consider the whole file as a single text block and use the text model set only.
      Useful when text data is misclassified as binary or fragments in a text file are incorrectly detected as some
      other block type.

---------------------------------------
 5. LSTM-Specific Options (expert-only)
---------------------------------------

  -lstmlayers=N

      Set the number of LSTM layers to N. Using more layers generally leads to better compression, but memory use
      will be higher (scales linearly with N) and compression time will be significantly slower. The default is N=2.

  -savelstm:text FILE

      Saves the LSTM model's learned parameters as a lossless snapshot to the specified file when compression finishes.
      Only the model used for text block(s) will be saved.
      It's not possible to save a snapshot from other block types. This is an experimental feature.

  -loadlstm:text FILE

      Loads the LSTM model's learned parameters from the specified file (which was saved earlier
      by the -savelstm:text option) before compression starts. The LSTM model will use this loaded
      snapshot to bootstrap its predictions.
      At levels -1L .. -12L only text blocks are affected.
      At level -0L all blocks are affected (because a single LSTM model is used for all block types).
      Critical: The same snapshot file MUST be used during decompression or the original content cannot be recovered.

----------------------
 6. Archive Operations
----------------------

  -d  Decompress an archive.
      In single-file mode the content is decompressed, the name of the output is the name of the archive without
      the .paq8px216 extension.
      In multi-file mode first the @LISTFILE is extracted then the rest of the files. Any required folders will
      be created recursively, all files will be extracted with their original names.
      If the output file or files already exist they will be overwritten.

      Example: to decompress file.txt to the current folder:
      paq8px -d file.txt.paq8px216

  -t  Test archive contents by decompressing to memory and comparing with the original data on-the-fly.
      If a file fails the test, the first mismatched position will be printed to screen.

      Example: to test archive contents:
      paq8px -t file.txt.paq8px216

  -l  List archive contents.
      Extracts and prints the embedded @FILELIST (if present).
      Applicable only to multi-file archives.

      Example: to list the file list (when the archive was created using @files):
      paq8px -l files.paq8px216

----------------------------------
 7. INPUT and OUTPUT Specification
----------------------------------

  INPUT may be:

  * A single file
  * A path/file
  * A [path/]@FILELIST

  In multi-file mode (i.e. when @FILELIST is provided) only file names, file contents and file sizes are stored
  in the archive. Timestamps, permissions, attributes or any other metadata are not preserved unless stored
  separately and manually by the user in the FILELIST.

  OUTPUT is optional:

    For compression:

    * If omitted, the archive is created in the current directory.
      The name of the archive: INPUT + paq8px216 extension appended.
    * If a filename is given, it is used as the archive name.
    * If a directory is given, the archive is created inside it.
    * If the archive file already exists, it will be overwritten.

    For decompression:

    * If an output filename is not provided, the output will be named the same as the archive without
      the paq8px216 extension.
    * If a filename is given, it is used as the output name.
    * If a directory is given, the restored file will be created inside it (the directory must exist).
    * If the output file(s) already exist, they will be overwritten.

  Examples:

  To create data.txt.paq8px216 in current directory:
  paq8px -8 data.txt

  To create archive.paq8px216 in current directory:
  paq8px -8 data.txt archive.paq8px216

  To create data.txt.paq8px216 in results/ directory:
  paq8px -8 data.txt results/

---------------------------------
 8. @FILELIST Format and Behavior
---------------------------------

  When a @FILELIST is provided, the FILELIST file itself is compressed as the first file in the archive and
  automatically extracted during decompression.

  The FILELIST is a tab-separated text file with this structure:

    Column 1:  Filenames and optional relative paths (required, used by compressor)
    Column 2+: Arbitrary metadata - timestamps, ownership, etc. (optional, preserved but ignored)

    First line: Header (preserved but ignored during processing the file list)

  Only the first column is used by the compressor and decompressor.
  All other columns are preserved but ignored.
  Paths must be relative to the FILELIST location.

  Using this mechanism allows full restoration of file metadata with third-party tools after decompression.


-------------------------
 9. Miscellaneous Options
-------------------------

  -v

    Enable verbose output.

  -log FILE

    Append compression results to a tab-separated log file.
    Logging applies only to compression.

  -simd MODE

    Normally, the highest usable SIMD instruction set is detected and used automatically

    - for the CM mixer - supported: SSE2, AVX2, AVX512, ARM NEON
    - for neural network operations in the LSTM model - supported: SSE2, AVX2
    - for the LSM and OLS predictors (used mainly in image and audio models) - supported: SSE3.
    - for the SimilarityModel: AVX2, SSE41.

    This option overrides the detected SIMD instruction set. Intended for expert use and benchmarking.
    Supported values (case-insensitive):
       NONE
       SSE2, SSE3, SSE41, AVX2, AVX512 (on x64)
       NEON (on ARM)

    Note that when paq8px is compiled for a specific CPU architecture, the compiler may automatically
    vectorize some parts of the code. While selecting 'NONE' disables all manually optimized SIMD
    implementations, the remaining scalar code may still be auto-vectorized by the compiler and
    therefore may not be entirely free of vector instructions.

----------------------
 10. Argument Ordering
----------------------

  Command-line arguments may appear in any order with the following exception:
  INPUT must always precede OUTPUT.

  Example: the following two are equivalent:

    paq8px -v -simd sse2 enwik8 -log results.txt output/ -8
    paq8px -8 enwik8 -log results.txt output/ -v -simd sse2

  Further examples:

    paq8px -8 file.txt         | Compress using ~2.3 GB RAM
    paq8px -12L enwik8         | Compress 'enwik8' with maximum compression (~29 GB RAM), use the LSTM model as well
    paq8px -4 image.jpg        | Compress the 'image.jpg' file - using less memory, even faster
    paq8px -8ba b64sample.xml  | Compress 'b64sample.xml' faster and using less memory
                                 Put more effort into finding and transforming DEFLATE blocks
                                 Use adaptive learning rate.
    paq8px -8s rafale.bmp      | Compress the 'rafale.bmp' image file
                                 Skip color transform - this file compresses better without it
```

## Compatibility & archive basics

A `paq8px` archive stores one or more files in a highly compressed format.

> [!NOTE]
> Files and archives larger than 2 GB are not supported.

> [!NOTE]
> `paq8px` archives are not compatible across different `paq8px` releases (past or future).

> [!NOTE]
> A `paq8px` archive may contain multiple files, but once created, you cannot add to or remove files from the archive.

### How to recognize it

The file extension reflects the exact `paq8px` version that created it (e.g., `.paq8px216`).  
You can also check the header: if the first bytes read "paq8px", it is likely a `paq8px` archive.  
Exact version information cannot be inferred from the archive content: the archive header does not encode the specific `paq8px` version used. Only the file extension reflects the version.

### Single file vs multiple file modes

In **single-file mode**, only file contents are stored – no paths, names, timestamps, attributes, permissions, or other metadata.

In **multi-file mode**, you may preserve such metadata via the @FILELIST mechanism (see the help screen for details).

### Notes on pre-training

> [!WARNING]  
> Archives made with pre-training-like options (`-E`, `-T`, `-R`) are fragile - decompression requires the same binary and/or external files.

1. **The exe pre-training (`-E`)**  
This option pre-trains the EXE model using the paq8px.exe binary itself.  
Archives created with a different paq8px.exe binary (even when built from the same source and build options) will differ.  
To decompress an archive created with `-E`, you must use the exact same executable that created it.

2. **Text pre-training (`-T`)**  
The word list (`english.dic`) and expression list (`english.exp`) are used only to pre-train models before compression and they are not stored in the archive.  
You must have these same files available to decompress archives created with `-T`.

3. **LSTM pre-trained weight repositories (`-R`)**  
If you use pre-trained LSTM repositories, ensure the same RNN weight files (`english.rnn`, `x86_64.rnn`) are available during decompression.

> [!WARNING]  
> The LSTM repositories are temporarily unavailable in the latest release due to the refactoring of the model.
> The latest version supporting this feature was v209.

## How to compile

Building `paq8px` requires a `C++17` capable `C++` compiler:  
[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support#cpp17](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support#cpp17)

**Windows:**  
On Windows, you can download a prebuilt executable instead of compiling it yourself.  
Just grab the executable from the [latest release](/releases/latest), or alternatively from one of the release announcement posts in the [paq8px thread](https://encode.su/threads/342-paq8px/) on the encode.su forum.  
If you would like to build an executable yourself you may use the Visual Studio solution file or in case of Mingw-w64 see the `build-mingw-w64-generic-publish.cmd` batch file in the build subfolder.

**Linux/macOS:**  
The ./build folder already contains helper scripts.  
You may use the following commands to build with cmake:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential zlib1g-dev cmake make
cd build
./build-linux-with-cmake.sh
```

### Testing in a Linux VM

- Get a Linux VM (such as Lubuntu 25.04 Plucky Puffin)
- Install the required compilers and tools with the following commands:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc clang gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu g++-aarch64-linux-gnu build-essential cmake zlib1g-dev
```

Sample build scripts are provided in the build/ folder:
- `build/build-linux-with-cmake.sh`
- `build/build-linux-with-gcc.sh`
- `build/build-linux-with-clang.sh`
- `build/build-linux-cross-compile-aarch64.sh`

Other modern C++17 compilers may also work but are not routinely tested.

> [!NOTE]
> We build and test 64-bit releases. 32-bit releases are seldom built or tested.  
> A known limitation of 32-bit releases is the 2 GB memory barrier. As a consequence, compression and decompression with 32-bit releases may not work ("out of memory") on level 8 and above.

## Release checklist

When you make a new release:

- Please update the version number in the "Versioning" section in the `paq8px.cpp` source file.
- Please append a short description of your modifications to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG) file.
- Please carry out some sanity checks. Run these tests with asserts on (remove the `NDEBUG` preprocessor directive).
- Please verify if paq8px can be properly built on different platforms (i.e. test all the build scripts)
- Update README.md, especially the Benchmark results.

## Statistical Compression and Context Mixing

`paq8px` belongs to the family of **statistical compressors**, more specifically to the class of **Context Mixing (CM)** compressors.

Statistical compressors estimate the probability of symbols in upcoming data based on previously processed input.  
These probabilities are then encoded using an entropy coder (typically arithmetic coding or range coding) to produce the compressed bitstream.

### Context Mixing

Unlike compressors that rely primarily on a single dominant context model or a strict context hierarchy (such as many PPM, DMC, or CTW implementations), Context Mixing combines predictions from many models simultaneously.

Each model specializes in recognizing different structures or patterns in the input data.  
A so called 'mixer' combines their predictions into a single probability estimate for the next bit.

This ensemble-style approach is computationally expensive: compression proceeds bit-by-bit and requires evaluating many models for every processed symbol.  
The trade-off is significantly higher compression ratios at the cost of speed and memory usage.

### Fast CM vs Extreme CM

Some Context Mixing compressors prioritize speed by using fewer contexts or switching to byte-oriented processing when prediction confidence is high.
These are often referred to as `fast CM` compressors.
A notable example is [MCM](https://github.com/mathieuchartier/mcm).

`paq8px`, like most PAQ-derived compressors, instead pursues extreme compression, sacrificing runtime and memory efficiency to achieve the highest possible compression ratio.

Well-known compressors in this category include:
- `paq8px`
- `paq8pxd`
- `cmix`

## How it works

`paq8px` compresses files **bit by bit** using a technique called **Context Mixing** (CM).
multiple models make probabilistic predictions for the next bit, and a mixer combines them into a single,
more accurate probability, which is then encoded with an arithmetic coder.

This approach is computationally intensive but highly adaptive, making `paq8px` especially effective
for **entropy estimation**, **compressibility testing** and **research** purposes.

For an in-depth technical explanation, see the [DOC](DOC) file.

### Calgary corpus

The Calgary corpus does not have an official maintained ranking, and most published results do not include modern experimental compressors.

Below are compressed sizes under various options, compared to `cmix v21` as reference.

With fair options (`-12L`), `paq8px v216` surpasses `cmix v21` (pure, with no dictionary pre-processing).  
With unfair options (v209 `-12RT` vs `cmix v21` with dictionary preprocessing), results surpass cmix even more, but these should be excluded for fairness (see [Benchmarking Notes](#benchmarking-notes)).

At the time of writing, `paq8px v216` likely ranks #1 on the Calgary corpus.

### Canterbury corpus

The same general notes apply to the Canterbury corpus as to the Calgary corpus.  

Below are compressed sizes under various options, compared to `cmix v21`.

### Lossless Photo Compression Benchmark (LPCB)

`paq8px v206` **ranked #1** at [Lossless Photo Compression Benchmark](http://qlic.altervista.org/).

The benchmark has not been rerun for later versions.

### Large Text Compression Benchmark (LTCB)

`paq8px v206` **ranked #11** at [Large Text Compression Benchmark](https://www.mattmahoney.net/dc/text.html) at the time of writing.  
Note, that unlike paq8px, most higher-ranked compressors are tuned specifically for enwik8/enwik9, and often apply enwik-specific preprocessing (e.g., word replacement, article reordering).  

The benchmark has not been rerun for later versions.

### Darek's corpus (DBA)

Darek's benchmark is not an exhaustive benchmark – it targets only high-end compressors.

See the last results in [Darek's post to the encode.su forum](https://encode.su/threads/342-paq8px?p=87989&viewfull=1#post87989) from 2026 including results for v215.

`paq8px v215` **ranked #1** at that time.

### MaximumCompression benchmark

The MaximumCompression benchmark is no longer actively maintained and has no up-to-date official listing.  
The official site was last updated in 2011. At that time `paq8px` **ranked #1**.

See `paq8px` evolution on the MaximumCompression benchmark up until `paq8px` v215 in [Darek's post to the encode.su forum](https://encode.su/threads/342-paq8px?p=88256&viewfull=1#post88256) from 2026.

### Benchmarking Notes

> [!WARNING]
> When a compressor uses a substantial amount of external data, such as...
>   - **pre-trained models** (e.g. paq8px: pre-trained weight repositories `-R`)
>   - **word lists** for model pre-training (e.g. paq8px: text pre-training `-T`)
>   - **dictionaries** for word replacement transformation or sorted dictionaries containing pre-computed semantic information (e.g. cmix: dictionary preprocessing)
>   - pre-calculated **content sorting** (e.g. cmix: new_article_order for sorting articles in enwik9)
>   
> ...the comparison is **unfair** when this information is not accounted for, i.e. their size and/or runtime is not included as part of the compressed size/time.
> Unless explicitly stated otherwise, we benchmark `paq8px` in a fully self-contained configuration, learning data from scratch without such external resources.
> We apply the same requirement to all compressors compared against `paq8px`.

> [!NOTE]
> 1) Some compressors use text-preprocessing with external dictionaries (e.g. `cmix v21`). While `paq8px` doesn't use such techniques, external preprocessing tools (such as [fxd](https://github.com/kaitz/fxd) or `cmix -s`) may optionally be applied to text files to improve compression performance.
> 2) Benchmarks and leaderboards change over time – rankings may shift.
> 3) Hardware does not affect compression ratio and memory use, but it does affect runtime; reported times are approximate on an AVX2-capable system and provided for context only.
